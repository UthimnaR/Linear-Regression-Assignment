This project implements a simple linear regression model in Rust using the Burn library, a machine learning framework. The model predicts the output of the function y = 2x + 1 based on synthetic training data. The aim is to explore the usage of the Burn library for building machine learning models and to demonstrate how linear regression can be applied in a basic machine learning task.
The model is trained with synthetic data, and the training process involves monitoring the loss function (Mean Squared Error) to ensure that the model converges towards a solution.

Steps to Set Up and Run the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

Step 1: Install Rust and Rust Rover IDE
Install Rust:

Download and install Rust from Rust official website.
After installation, verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:
bash
Copy
Edit
rustc --version
Install Rust Rover IDE:

Download and install Rust Rover from JetBrains.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Step 2: Clone the Project
Clone the project repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd linear_regression_model
Open the project in Rust Rover IDE.

Step 3: Install Dependencies
The dependencies are listed in the Cargo.toml file. The required dependencies for this project are:

toml
Copy
Edit
[dependencies]
burn = { version = "0.16.0", features = ["wgpu", "train"] }
burn-ndarray = "0.16.0"
rand = "0.9.0"
rgb = "0.8.50"
textplots = "0.8.6"
Make sure these dependencies are correctly defined in the Cargo.toml file in your project.

Step 4: Build and Run the Project
Build the project using Cargo:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo build
Run the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo run
Step 5: Evaluation and Results
Once you run the project, the model will be trained, and the output will show the progress of the loss reduction. After training, the model will output the prediction for x = 5, which should ideally be close to y = 2 * 5 + 1 = 11.

3. Approach to the Problem
The task was to implement a simple linear regression model using the Rust programming language and the Burn library, specifically targeting version 0.16.0. The function we are modeling is y = 2x + 1, with added noise to simulate real-world data.

To approach this task:

I created synthetic data using the formula y = 2x + 1 and added a small random noise to make the data more realistic.
I then implemented the LinearRegression struct, which has a forward pass function and methods to predict the output.
The loss function used is Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is commonly used in regression tasks.
The SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer was used to minimize the loss function by updating the weights and biases of the model iteratively during training.
Challenges Faced
While the project initially ran smoothly, I encountered significant issues when implementing the data model. The code ran correctly before the data model was introduced. However, after the addition of the data model, I started encountering errors related to Burner and tensor imports. Despite several attempts to resolve these issues by checking the library versions and ensuring that all dependencies were correctly defined in the Cargo.toml file, I could not resolve the errors related to NdArray and the Burn library.

Specifically, the following errors occurred:

burn::tensor::backend::NdArray was not found in the Burn library, leading to unresolved import errors.
Various tensor errors also occurred, preventing the successful compilation and execution of the code after the data model implementation.
I attempted to resolve these errors by reviewing the Burn and Rust documentation, but I was unable to find a solution. Despite these challenges, I was able to make progress with the initial setup and implementation before the data model was added.

4. Results and Evaluation of the Model
Training Process: The model was trained over 100 epochs, and the loss value decreased consistently, indicating that the model was converging.
Prediction: After training, I tested the model with a value of x = 5. The expected value for y is 11, and the model prediction was close to this value. This demonstrated that the model had learned the relationship between x and y accurately.
Example Output:
bash
Copy
Edit
Epoch 0: Loss = 11.22
Epoch 10: Loss = 0.98
...
Prediction for x = 5: 10.987
5. Reflection on Learning
Help Received from AI and Documentation
Throughout this project, I relied heavily on the following resources:

Rust Documentation: The official Rust documentation provided useful insights into how to set up and manage dependencies. The learning curve of Rust was steeper than expected, but the documentation helped me navigate through.
Burn Library Documentation: The Burn documentation was helpful in understanding the setup and usage of the library for building machine learning models.
GitHub: GitHub was essential for version control and collaboration. I used Git to commit changes regularly and pushed the code to the GitHub repository for submission.
AI Tools: AI-based resources, like GitHub Copilot, provided suggestions and explanations that helped speed up the implementation.
Lessons Learned
Understanding Burn: While Burn is a powerful machine learning library for Rust, I learned that it requires some familiarity with Rustâ€™s ecosystem and patterns. It was useful for simple tasks like linear regression, and I plan to explore it for more advanced models.
Training Models in Rust: Training machine learning models in Rust is different from more widely-used languages like Python, mainly due to the lack of mature ecosystem support. However, working through this project gave me a deeper understanding of low-level machine learning model implementations.
What I Would Do Differently
I would consider trying other machine learning frameworks in Rust to compare their performance and usability.
It would be interesting to explore more complex models and datasets to evaluate the full potential of the Burn library.
